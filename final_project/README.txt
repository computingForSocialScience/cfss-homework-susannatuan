With this project, Jenna and I successfully pulled data from Facebook; however, immediately after we ran into a variety of problems trying to run mysql. We created a few tables, and then ran into access errors when we tried to start mysql back up again. This problem placed a huge damper on this project, because without mysql running successfully we could not add anything to our existing tables. From here, we could not select data from the table in order display information on our server using flask.

Despite this significant problem that we faced at the onset, we did the best we could in writing scripts, which would execute the assignment successfully once we get mysql to function properly. The risk associated with this is that we could not work off of any errors (since the error always went back to not having access within mysql). We exhausted a number of options trying to write a code without updated error messages.

Thank you very much for your help.
